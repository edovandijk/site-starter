# Site Starter

A tiny, tiny site starter kit. 

### What is this?
A simple set of `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `scripts.js` files all linked together, without anything else added.

### How do you use this?
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/tyhopp/site-starter` from your terminal to download these files. 
2. Run `cd site-starter` to navigate into the project repository.
3. When inside the project directory, setup your local server. I think [MDN's suggested approach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server) is the simplest. To do this:
	- Run `python -V` to find out what Python version you have. If you don't have Python, [download it here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
	- If you have Python version 2+, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. 
	- If you have Python version 3+, run `python -m http.server`.

### Why?

Every time I want to test something in the browser I have the following three options:

- Open CodePen or JSFiddle and constantly have to resize the windows as I write more and more code. 
- Google "HTML Boilerplate" only to find giant boilerplate templates, each with their own set of opinionated things included. 
- Create the files from scratch and fill in the basic elements. 

I almost always choose the third. This kit does that for you, just follow the steps above.
